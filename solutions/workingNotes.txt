Longest Common String:

You never have to shrink the window; those smaller strings will implicitely never win. Transpose the window over if you fail to find something after a growth step.

When the end boundary is at the end of the smaller string, you're done.

After you find a match, grow the window. No need to check for matching sizes, I suppose.

Add these pycharm hidden files to my gitignore.
